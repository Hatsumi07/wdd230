        <h2>Carmen Maria Gonzales Castillo</h2>
        <p>
            Carmen is around her forties and lives with her daughter, whom she raised alone, is a university student of twenty. Carmen has owned a small store, which used to be her family´s even smaller store, at a local market in Comas where she sells fruits and vegetables. She wants to start a business where she can apply her knowledge on sales. She has a basic level of education, she has only finished high school, but she feels confident about her sales skills, which she has been developing for over twenty years working in her small store. She mainly uses her cellphone. It is her most important mean of communication because she can contact her providers and take advantage of the new payment apps throughout the day. Her second most important device is her desktop because she can keep track of the sales of the day in Excel sheets. Since she took a basic Excel course, which she found in an advertisement in Facebook, she has replaced her old sales notebook that used to help her to keep track of sales. She also enjoys spending her free time in her cellphone to get the latest news on the world and on her family through Facebook. She usually feels attracted by the advertisement she sees in Facebook or YouTube. Recently Carmen saw an advertisement in Facebook about the Comas chamber of commerce, so she decided to take a look. Since she is not good with technology, she tried to figure out how to know more about the site. Hopefully she found the icon to contact an advisor to guide her through the site and explain to her what is the chamber commerce for. Carmen was able to  join happily the chamber of commerce.

        <p>
            Juan is twenty-five years old; he has finished his career in business management. He comes from a middle-income family, which paid for his career. Now that he has finished school, he wants to start a business, and since he has heard about the recent increase in the food business in Comas, he has been thinking about opening a restaurant. Given to his knowledge in business he wants to base his decision of starting a business in sound facts and wants to understand better the market in Comas. He prefers using laptops over desktops because they are more portable. He enjoys spending time with his friends and family, and he expects that if he starts a business, he wouldn´t have to spend most of his time working. He likes testing new apps that as he says, “make life easier”. Whenever he is working, he uses most of the time his laptop, but in in his free time he prefers using his cellphone. A friend of Juan recently recommended to Juan the app Comas chamber of commerce, and he explained to Juan that he could get more information of the market in Comas through the app and contact other business owners in Comas, so he could expand his network.
